			- testing_plan: Outline a plan for testing the plugin to ensure it functions correctly. There will be no test suite for the plugin, you just have to explain how the plugin works, so it can be tested correctly. The user may not be technical, so the plan should be clear and easy to follow.

			Do not add any additional commentary. Make sure your response only contains a valid JSON object with the specified sections. Do not use Markdown formatting in your answer.

			Generate a detailed technical specification and development plan for a WordPress plugin with the following features:
			
			```
			$input
			```
			
			This will be a complex multi-file plugin with proper directory structure. Do not write the actual plugin code. Your response should be a valid JSON object, with clear and concise text in each of the following sections:
			
			- plugin_name: Provide a concise name for the plugin.
			- design_and_architecture: Outline the overall design and architecture of the plugin, including data flow and major components. Keep it simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.
			- detailed_feature_description: Provide a detailed description of each feature, explaining how it should be implemented with minimal code.
			- user_interface: Describe the user interface elements and how users will interact with the plugin. Focus on essential UI elements only.
			- user_flows: Describe the main steps users will follow to accomplish key tasks with the plugin. Outline each flow as a sequence of actions, focusing on typical scenarios and making them easy to understand for non-technical users.
			- security_considerations: Discuss any security measures that need to be incorporated to ensure the plugin's safety.
			- testing_plan: Outline a plan for testing the plugin to ensure it functions correctly. There will be no test suite for the plugin, you just have to explain how the plugin works, so it can be tested correctly. The user may not be technical, so the plan should be clear and easy to follow.
			- project_structure: Define the file and directory structure for this plugin. This should include:
				- directories: Array of directory paths needed for the plugin (e.g., "includes/", "assets/css/", "assets/js/", "admin/")
				- files: Array of file objects, each containing:
					- path: The file path relative to plugin root
					- type: File type (php, css, or js only)
					- description: Brief description of the file's purpose
				
				Only include PHP, CSS, and JS files. No other file types. Ensure proper WordPress plugin structure with a main plugin file, and organize code logically into separate files. Keep the file structure minimal and only create files that are absolutely necessary.
			
			IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
			- Avoid over-engineering: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to accomplish the user's specifications
			- The plugin must be self-contained and cannot use external libraries or require build steps
			- Only use external dependencies if explicitly specified in the user's requirements
			- Keep the implementation simple and straightforward
			- Focus on core functionality rather than adding unnecessary features
			
			Do not add any additional commentary. Make sure your response only contains a valid JSON object with the specified sections. Do not use Markdown formatting in your answer.

			You are reviewing a complete WordPress plugin codebase for critical errors that would prevent it from working. Your goal is to identify issues that would break the plugin's functionality.

			Plugin Plan:
			```
			$plugin_plan
			```

			$context

			Analyze the codebase for critical issues only:
			- Syntax errors in PHP, CSS, or JavaScript
			- Missing required WordPress functions or hooks
			- Incorrect file references or dependencies between files
			- Critical security vulnerabilities that would cause immediate problems
			- Function/class name conflicts or undefined references
			- Missing essential WordPress plugin requirements (like proper plugin headers)
			
			If the plugin appears to work correctly as specified in the plan, respond with an empty suggestions array.
			
			Your response should be a valid JSON object with the following structure:
			{
				"review_summary": "Brief summary - either 'No critical issues found' or describe the problems",
				"suggestions": [
					{
						"action": "UPDATE",
						"file_path": "path/to/file.php",

						"reason": "Critical issue that prevents plugin from working",
						"description": "Specific fix needed to resolve the issue"

			Guidelines:
			- ONLY suggest fixes for issues that would prevent the plugin from functioning
			- Do NOT suggest improvements, additional features, or optimizations
			- Do NOT suggest new files unless something is critically missing
			- Focus on making the existing code work, not making it better
			- If the plugin will likely work as intended, return empty suggestions array
			- Maximum 5 suggestions for only the most critical issues
			
			Return ONLY the JSON response without any explanation or markdown formatting.
